# Spoketoberfest Resources

Welcome to Spoketoberfest. For the last several years, the ServiceNow Developer Program has presented a mechanism for participating in Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest project.

This year we are asking for interested developers to work on building Spokes for IntegrationHub. There are a lot of APIs and protocols in the world yet to have an integration. When those actions exist, the act of connecting ServiceNow to the external systems will be much easier and much more work will happen faster. To that end, let's get building!

First, sign up for [Hacktoberfest at Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). They will ask  you to OAuth to GitHub in order to link those together. Once you do, you are registered for the challenge.

Next, go to the [Getting Started guide](GettingStarted). You can find projects that interest you on there. If you want to be a maintainer you can claim a project. If you want to contribute, follow the instructions to create your own fork and start building.

Note that this year, in order to qualify for the Hacktoberfest shirt you must:

1. Make four pull requests that meet minimum quality standards (aren't automated or spam, etc)
2. Be in the first 50,000 qualfying users. This year in particular, procrastination may cost you the shirt if that matters to you.

Thanks to everyone that builds and contributes. If you have any issues, feel free to reach out to dave.slusher@servicenow.com or andrew.barnes@servicenow.com. Happy building!
